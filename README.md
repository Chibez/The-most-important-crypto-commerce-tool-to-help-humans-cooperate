In my view I covered extensively the most important aspects and tools of the crypto world at large and how they can be put into proper use.

They are as follows:

Key benefits of P2P crypto trading

The cryptocurrency market has sky-rocketed over the past couple of years. Although the market can dramatically fluctuate, an estimated 106 million people worldwide now use cryptocurrency exchanges. Created 13 years ago, the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was relatively unheard of for the first years of its existence, only used by a small group who sought to retain a level of transactional anonymity.

Cyber security

Yet, as more people invest and businesses establish it as a payment method, cryptocurrency is increasingly becoming a tool for cyber criminals. There is already evidence of this: Bitcoin now accounts for around 98% of ransom payments. Cyber criminals often deploy ransomware attacks by running code to encrypt data and then demanding payment in the form of cryptocurrency to release it. As identities can be hidden in Bitcoin wallets, it is the obvious choice for cyber criminals to get what they want and remain anonymous. 
Whilst cyber criminals are using cryptocurrency to remain anonymous, they are also taking advantage of the vulnerabilities and unsecured areas of these new and fast-developing technologies. By stealing the account keys of crypto wallets, cyber criminals can permanently lock users out, gaining access to entire investments. For this reason, it’s crucial that crypto accounts are treated with the utmost caution.
Cryptojacking is one of the most common ways that cyber criminals access users’ accounts. This is the practice of hijacking a computer to mine cryptocurrencies without the user’s knowledge. Usually, no personal information is stolen whilst the code is running to avoid detection for a long period, in which time a cyber criminal can make a significant amount of money.
Another way cyber criminals utilise cryptojacking is through the cloud. ‘Cloud cryptojacking’ occurs when hackers steal an organisation’s credentials to gain access to their cloud environment where they run their cryptojacking code, rather than on a local device.

Stay one step ahead

With cryptocurrency here to stay for the long-term, it is important to balance the possible cyber security risks with the opportunities they offer. Crypto users should be mindful of the risks and can take steps to protect their investment from falling into the wrong hands. Here are five top tips to keep your money and computer systems safe:
Know the cyber security basics: As many cyber criminals use techniques, such as phishing emails, to gain access to user accounts, ensuring that you and your employees are focused on cyber security is the best and easiest way to start. For instance, being able to identify dangerous messages and avoiding potential malicious links is a solid step towards denying cyber criminals access to your company’s computer system and crypto wallets.
Prioritise password protection:   To deny cyber criminals the ability to engage in cryptojacking, it is important that organisations should combine effective password management with multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorised access. This will significantly reduce the possibility of cyber criminals gaining access to cloud environments and IT assets.
Keep your eyes open:   Cryptojacking takes place in the background and can often go undetected for long periods of time. The best and easiest way to quickly identify if cyber criminals have infiltrated your system is through constant monitoring. Network monitoring tools can also aid in monitoring systems and send alerts if suspicious activities are spotted.
Consult the CCSS:   The Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) lays out an open source set of requirements to standardize the techniques and methodologies used by cryptocurrency systems across the globe. The process includes 10 security aspects – including wallet creation, key storage, key usage and data sanitization policy – and scores them across three levels. Security considered ‘level one’ proves that assets are protected with strong policies and procedures whilst those deemed ‘level three’ exceed security expectations and provide strictly enforced policies. Users should consult the CCSS to identify the best cryptocurrency systems to use and keep their currency safe.
Stay ahead of the curve with CDR:     Businesses using cryptocurrency can adopt file sanitisation to ensure there is no chance of malicious code running in the background. Proactive cyber security solutions, such as content disarm and reconstruction (CDR), help organisations to be one step ahead of cyber criminals. CDR ensures that no malicious malware is present within a file by scanning it and re-building it to the known good manufacturer’s specification.


Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway

A cryptocurrency payment gateway is a payment processor for digital currencies, similar to the payment processors, gateways, and acquiring bank credit cards use. Cryptocurrency gateways enable you to accept digital payments and recieve fiat currency immediately in exchange. 
These companies remove any uncertainties or reservations you might have with cryptocurrency and allow you to offer more payment options. 
It's important to note that digital currency payment gateways are not required. It's perfectly acceptable to use your personal wallet to accept cryptocurrency payments; however, gateways take the extra work of exchanging cryptcurrency and managing a wallet out of your hands. 

Payment Flow

In terms of steps, the following workflow gets executed: 
1.	Your customer opts to make payment in cryptocurrency at checkout (in-store, on the web, or in-app).
2.	They pay you an amount equal to the digital currency's fair market value at the time of the transaction.
3.	The cryptocurrency payment service instantly converts the payment into the currency you choose.
4.	The money is added to your account with the provider; it is deposited to your designated bank account in intervals decided on in your service contract.
The process is transparent to you because you don't have to worry about cryptocurrencies; only that your cryptocurrency service provider will place the appropriate funds in your account.
Be sure to check your country's cryptocurrency regulations before setting up an account with a gateway. These gateways can operate from anywhere in the world, and many countries are developing new laws regarding digital currency use.

Fees 

The provider uses a cryptocurrency wallet to facilitate the transfers. If that currency is designed with a payment system, the provider will incur fees charged by the currency network's transaction validators. 
Transaction validators verify blocks and transactions in the blockchain—in exchange for their energy use and computional power, they are paid in small increments in the cryptocurrency transaction they validated. 
The providers pass on these fees to you, and charge their service fees so that they can continue operating and offering their services. 

Payment Gateways 

By nature, cryptocurrency is designed to be decentralized and anonymous. The system makes it easy for two parties to make an exchange. However, some merchants might not be comfortable accepting payment in digital currency; they might not understand how any of it works or be skeptical about the system. 
For these reasons, it's important to know the advantages and disadvantages of payment gateways so that you can decide how you want to accept digital currency payments. 

Benefits

•	A payment gateway removes the anonymity of who you're dealing with while maintaining your customer's preference for it.

•	You have someone to contact if there are payment issues.

•	You can accept payments from anywhere in the world, in any cryptocurrency your provider will take.

•	You receive the funds in the account with your provider, who transfers them to you.

•	You don't have to worry about or attempt to understand cryptocurrency.

•	Reduces volatility risk—the risk of losing value waiting for a transaction to be verified by the cryptocurrency's network—by paying you the market rate for the tokens at the time the transaction was conducted.


Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading

Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is a type of cryptocurrency exchange method that allows traders to trade directly with one another without the need for a centralized third party to facilitate the transactions. 
Unlike traditional Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges, which typically have strict regulations and require users to go through a verification process before they can access and use the platform, P2P trading platforms tend to be much more relaxed in terms of their requirements.
In P2P trading, you can select your preferred offer and trade directly with a counterparty rather than using an automated engine to execute your transactions. This means you have more freedom to pick the best rate and payment method for your needs—and with lower costs. You can also better safeguard your privacy because you're dealing directly with a counterparty. 


Some key benefits of P2P crypto trading

Multiple payment methods: Because P2P crypto trading platforms simply connect buyers and sellers, they can provide a wide variety of different payment methods. This can include traditional payment methods, such as credit cards and PayPal, as well as digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), or Litecoin (LTC).

Secure transactions : P2P trading platforms often use security features such as encryption and two-factor authentication to protect trade. As a result, users can feel confident that their funds are safe when engaging in transactions on these networks.

Exposes you to a global marketplace where you can buy and sell to users globally: The global nature of P2P crypto trading allows users to work with anyone, regardless of location. This opens up a world of possibilities, as it allows you to trade in any currency or asset that you like.

Restrictions do not apply even in nations with strict laws on crypto trading: Because P2P crypto trading platforms don't have a central authority, they can't be shut down by governments with strict crypto laws. This includes regulations specific to certain countries that may restrict how much cryptocurrency you can buy or sell.

Allows you to customize your offers with ad posting to attract sellers: P2P platforms often have marketplaces where users can advertise their offers to others. In addition, many of these networks allow you to customize your offer with different features, such as discounts and payment terms. These customization options aren't available on centralized exchanges and give you greater flexibility when trading cryptocurrencies.

No trading fee or commissions: Because P2P trading platforms connect sellers directly with buyers, they don't charge any fees or commissions on transactions. This gives you the freedom to buy and sell currencies without worrying about extra costs impacting your bottom line.

Great transaction speed: The transaction speed of P2P crypto trading platforms depends on the payment method used. For example, transactions made with credit cards are usually processed immediately. In contrast, those made via bank transfers may take a few days. Overall, though, the transaction speed is much faster than centralized exchanges.

Flexible trade orders: P2P trading platforms allow you to set your own trade orders, giving you more control over your trades. You can set the price at which you're willing to buy or sell, as well as the amount of currency you want to trade. This flexibility is not available on centralized exchanges, where the order book is managed by the exchange, itself.

Key features of a P2P platform

The key features you should look for in a P2P trading platform are:
•	User-friendly interface: To help you find the cryptocurrencies you're looking for easily and quickly as well as process and manage your trades, the platform should have an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
•	Robust security: The exchange should have robust security features, such as multi-factor authentication and encrypted storage for your coins to help protect your data and funds.
•	Reputation: To ensure that you're dealing with a legitimate and trustworthy platform, it's important to diligently research the exchange you're considering using. This includes looking at user reviews and checking for any red flags.
•	Supported currencies: When choosing a P2P exchange, ensure that it supports the cryptocurrencies you're interested in buying or selling.
•	Payment methods: The platform should offer a variety of payment methods to choose from, such as bank transfer, credit/debit card, or PayPal.
•	Fees: Be sure to check the fees charged by the platform, as these can vary depending on the exchange. You may also be charged fees by your payment provider when using certain methods to fund your account.
•	Customer support: It's important to have access to customer support if and when you face problems with the platform or need help with a trade.

How to initiate a P2P cryptocurrency exchange

To initiate a P2P cryptocurrency exchange, you will first need to find a platform that suits your needs. There are several different P2P crypto trading platforms available, so it's important to compare the features and fees of each before you decide on one.
Once you've found a platform you're happy with, you can create an account and deposit the currency you want to trade. Once your account is set up, you'll be able to post offers to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. You can also browse offers from other users and trade directly with them.
P2P crypto trading platforms do not have a central authority figure, so it's important to take steps to protect yourself from scams and other potential risks. This may include conducting thorough checks on potential sellers, using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, and always using a secure connection when trading currencies online.
